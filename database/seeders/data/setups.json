If you miss the bull and go on to lose deal with it. You had your chance. But it's a lot easier to deal with that loss if you at least had a dart to win. Imagine going high or low on the 2nd dart at treble 11 and missing completely leaving no out. Or going at the 25 and missing completely or being too accurate and hitting a bull.

Sounds like a smart thing to do until you hit a single 16. Now you've just left 64. You could have stayed on the 20's and left 60. Guess what 60 gives you? 2 darts at a double that's what. Or 50% darts at a double more than leaving 64. Don't go 16's with the last dart!"

A simple single 1 fixes things leaving 1 dart at double 4. Now hold on a minute!! Let's back this up.\r\r116 and you go 19's. Using the same exact scenario as above you miss low with your last dart leaving 20. The opponent misses. You get another turn. Ask yourself, is 20 a better out than 18? If you come inside on double 10 you still have 2 darts left in hand for a double. Not the case with 18 left. The difference is minor. Does it matter? Possibly."
