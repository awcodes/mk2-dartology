            <h2>Playing the Percentages</h2>

            <p>
                We all have good and bad days in darts, but wouldn't it be nice to increase your chances of winning x01
                games on those bad days? Well it's possible if you learn to play the percentages. Using the right checkouts will
                dramatically increase that chance and make the good days even better.

                Yea, we hear it all the time too, but we got you covered. Our Checkout Chart shows you the best way to
                go, based on playing the percentages, when trying to win a game.

                Sometimes it's hard to know what to do to get to the best check out. Our Setups tool will help you learn
                what the best thing to do is when you're trying to get to a good out before your opponent does.

                There's a lot of weird words and phrases you'll hear around the dart board. And by "a lot", we mean a
                ton (pun definitely intended). Have a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_darts">Glossary of darts on Widipedia.</a> to have your mind blown. ðŸ¤¯
