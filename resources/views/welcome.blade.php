    <h2>Practice Make Perfect</h2>

    <p class="text-sm italic">
        (well, maybe not perfect, but way better)
    </p>

    <p>
        We have a plethora of practice routines to help you achieve your darting goals, even if your goal is as simple
        as beating your friends in your local pub on a Tuesday night.
    </p>

    <a href="{{ route('routines.index') }}" class="mt-4 btn secondary md:inline-flex md:mr-4">All Practice Routines</a>

    <h2 class="mt-12">Playing the Percentages</h2>

    <p>
        We all have good and bad days in darts, but wouldn't it be nice to increase your chances of winning x01 games on
        those bad days? Well it's possible if you learn to play the percentages. Using the right checkouts will
        dramatically increase that chance and make the good days even better.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-12">What's My Out?</h2>

    <p>
        Yea, we hear it all the time too, but we got you covered. Our Checkout Chart shows you the best way to go, based
        on playing the percentages, when trying to win a game.
    </p>

    <a href="{{ route('checkouts') }}" class="mt-4 btn secondary md:inline-flex">Look up an Out</a>

    <h2 class="mt-12">What should I do?</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes it's hard to know what to do to get to the best check out. Our Setups tool will help you learn what
        the best thing to do is when you're trying to get to a good out before your opponent does.

    <h2 class="mt-12">What the hell is an 'oche' anyway?</h2>

    <p>
        There's a lot of weird words and phrases you'll hear around the dart board. And by "a lot", we mean a ton (pun
        definitely intended). Have a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_darts">Glossary of
            darts on Widipedia.</a> to
        have your mind blown. ðŸ¤¯
